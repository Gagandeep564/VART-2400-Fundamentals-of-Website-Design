            <h2 class="project-one"> Book Review 📚 </h2>
            <p class="project-one-paragraph"> For Project 1, we were tasked with creating a one-page website about our favorite book. I chose The Hunger Games, a story I’ve loved since childhood, whose themes have grown even more relevant over time. Inspired by Suzanne Collins’ experience flipping through news channels and observing real-world conflicts, the novel reflects pressing societal issues. My website offers an in-depth review, highlighting the book’s compelling narrative and its striking parallels to reality. <br><br><br>

            <p class="project-two-paragraph"> For Project 2, we were assigned to create a one-page website critique. I chose Glossier, focusing on how its color scheme, typography, and layout work together to shape its signature brand aesthetic. My analysis highlights how these design elements reinforce Glossier’s minimalist, modern image while also offering a few suggestions for enhancing user experience and accessibility.

            <h2 class="project-three"> Narrative 👁️ </h2>
            <p class="project-three-paragraph"> For Project 3, we were tasked with creating a storytelling website. I chose The Yellow Wallpaper to createa an immersive experience that visually paralleled and represented the protagonist's psychological descent. As viewers navigate the site, they witness her unraveling mental state through animations and illustrations. Every element seeks to reinforce the claustrophobic atmosphere, making the story’s themes of confinement and mental health more tangible.

            <h2 class="activity-one"> 10 Principles for Good Design 👩‍🎨 </h2>
            <p class="activity-one-paragraph"> For Activity 1, we were tasked with creating a website that reimagined Dieter Rams’ Ten Principles for Good Design using basic HTML and CSS. I chose to interpret these principles through the lens of fashion, emphasizing how timeless design values apply beyond product design. Each principle was paired with fashion imagery and styled with minimalist web elements to reflect Rams’ focus on simplicity and functionality.  <br><br><br>

            <p class="activity-two-paragraph"> For Activity 2, we were tasked with writing a reflective piece based on the course readings from previous weeks. I explored questions such as: <i>What is a website, really? Why publish content on the internet? Could websites become obsolete? </i>and <i>What is my personal relationship with technology?</i> This process deepened my understanding of the internet’s cultural significance and my place within the digital world.<br><br><br>

            <p class="activity-three-paragraph"> For Activity 3, we were assigned to create a responsive website that conveyed a simple narrative through adaptive design. I chose to represent the changing seasons of the year, using the website’s resizing functionality as a storytelling tool. As users adjust the browser size, they journey through spring, summer, fall, and winter, each represented by distinct color schemes. <br><br><br>
