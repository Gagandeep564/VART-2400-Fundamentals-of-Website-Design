            The world wide web has appeared to become a different world of its own with various spaces to share, explore, and discover much like our physical world. However, within this world corporations have begun to gradually infect and transform the space so much so that it increasingly resembles an oligarchy. In response to this, Laurel Schwulst calls for individuals to reclaim the internet and “breathe life” into it. Schwulst provides a different way of thinking about websites, they do not necessarily need to serve a monetary or extrinsic purpose but can rather be anything that an individual wants them to be thus, serving as a blank canvas.

            While websites can be anything and everything, J.R. Carpenter calls for a return to “handmade” websites that are coded by the individual as opposed to those coded by software. This message is very much aligned with Schwulst’s call for more websites for individuals rather than corporations. However, in an attempt to have more websites owned by individuals, it is necessary to make the tools to make a website accessible which softwares can do. It is necessary to recognize that people may not have the time to learn about and become comfortable with HTML, CSS, and Javascript which are necessary when coding a website by hand. However, I do think there is a beauty that “handmade” websites possess, they do not necessarily conform to most people’s definition of a website as is the case with Carpenter’s website. It showcases the individuality of a person.

            While individual websites much like our instagram, snapchat, tiktok, and twitter accounts will persist long after the individual however, as Chia Amisola puts it “decades later, these digital records are one of my only remains. I trace these sites, dissolving to time, assembling a fragmented collection of selves that tell a story of a becoming.” Thus, websites can tell a story about one’s existence. They can be viewed as archives for our older selves and future generations long after they have been last maintained and updated. The internet, unlike our physical world, has unlimited space to capture and store these archives.
