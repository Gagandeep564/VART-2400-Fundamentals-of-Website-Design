            Glossier is a well-known beauty brand that offers both skincare and makeup products. The website facilitates the direct purchase of beauty products by providing detailed information about the products, including ingredients and usage tips. The website, through consistent typography and color palette, reinforces the identity and aesthetic of the brand. The aesthetic of the website also provides insight into the target audience. The website primarily uses white, black, grey, light pink, and occasional pops of red, which, along with the Y2K design of the website, reveals that the target audience is primarily young women who value skincare and makeup.

                    Glossier utilizes typefaces in the san-serif family, which help convey the modernity and “freshness” of the brand. The use of soft pastel colors complements the modern aesthetic of the brand, with darker text providing contrast for readability. The website maintains a consistent color palette, fonts, and layouts throughout. The minimalist design allows products to be the focal point, reinforcing the brand's identity. <br><br>

                    The design of the homepage further showcases what Glossier sells which is primarily makeup, skin care products, and perfumes. So, even if users miss the navigation bar located at the header, as they scroll down, there are multiple links to direct them to different pages selling a particular type of product.<br><br>

                    In terms of visual hierarchy, the brand utilizes it ocassionally although the vast majority of the website has a similar font and font size. Their use of visual hierarchy is evident on the homepage where they have a brief description of their perfume, which is larger than the rest of the text, and a review is in a slightly smaller font beneath it. <br><br>

                    The website retains design and content when used on a smaller or bigger scale and adjusts accordingly, retaining the brand aesthetic despite the various elements included, like videos.

                    The content is pertinent to and aligned with the website’s purpose. All of the skincare and makeup products on the website feature sections on how to use the product, the ingredients of the product, and clinical studies (if relevant to the product). This transparency is helpful to users when determining what product to buy. By viewing the ingredients, users can avoid products that could cause an allergic reaction or breakouts. The clinical studies are especially relevant to skincare products and can aid users in determining if a product is truly effective. The how to use a product section is also helpful, especially for revisiting users who have bought a product and can reinform when and in what quantity to use a product in case they forget or loose the packaging. <br><br>
                    The filters used to sort products and categorize reviews further aid in the user experience as they can filter based on skin tone, type, and concerns helping users determine if they should buy a product. If they have oily skin, they can filter products to show products specifically designed for oily skin. They can use this in the review section as well to only showcase reviews of users that have similar skin types and skin tones. These categories in the filters further help user decision-making.

                    The website is very easy to use, and the homepage effectively directs users to key areas through clear menus, product filters, and a search bar. The navigation menu is intuitive. This allows users to find what they are looking for easily. <br><br>

                    One interesting thingss that Glossier incorporates is videos. The video on the homepage helps set the tone of the website and also establishes the audience they are targeting. The additional videos not only serve to promote a particular product, but some of them, especially the ones included after you click a skin care product, explain the product. These videos, in terms of how they are shot and the colors utilized, reinforce the brand aesthetic while also serving the function of informing the user. <br><br>

                    The website also allows users to see how a product may look on the skin without the prerequisite of clicking on the product, which can be helpful for users and help them save time while they are shopping. <br><br>

                    The website is not super interactive, but the ways in which it is helps create a smooth and efficient user experience.

            The website does a good job at providing an easy experience, combining aesthetic appeal with functionality. The layout is user-friendly and allows for easy navigation. The wesbite is most effective through its filters which allow you to filter based on skin type, concerns, and tone which allows users to easily access products that are suitable and geared towards them and their needs. <br><br>
            There are some minor recommendations which could posssibly enhance user experience. Many beauty brand websites often have swatches of a particular product on various skin types on one image, allowing users to effectively determine how a product may appear on their website. Some times there are only swatches of products on one or two skin type which can possibly deter people from buying a product. <br><br>
            Additionally, the website has a footer however, the footer has an index. I don’t think this is an effective use of space because users have both the navigation bar and search bar to aid them in their search. Additionally, they utilize specific product names which a first time user may not be familar with and may not know what type of product it is. If they wanted to incorporate an index, I believe incorporating it into the navigation or search bar would be more productive.
