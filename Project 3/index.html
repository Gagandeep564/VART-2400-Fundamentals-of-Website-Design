                    John is a physician, and perhaps—(I would not say it to a living soul, of course, but this is dead paper and a great relief to my mind)—perhaps that is one reason I do not get well faster.
                    <br>
                    You see, he does <b class="not">NOT</b> believe I am sick!
                    <br>
                    <b class="not">And what can one do?</b>
                    <br>
                    If a physician of high standing, and one’s own husband, assures friends and relatives that there is really nothing the matter with one but temporary nervous depression—a slight hysterical tendency—what is one to do?

                    But I must not think about that. This paper looks to me as if it knew what a vicious influence it had!
                    <br>
                    There is a recurrent spot where the pattern lolls like a broken neck and two bulbous eyes stare at you upside-down.
                    <br>
                    Up and down and sideways they crawl, and those absurd, unblinking <b class="not">eyes are everywhere.</b>
                    <br>
                    The wallpaper, as I said before, is torn off in spots, and it sticketh closer than a brother—they must have had perseverance as well as hatred.
                    <br>
                    This wallpaper has a kind of sub-pattern in a different shade, a particularly irritating one, for you can only see it in certain lights, and not clearly then.
                    <br>
                    But in the places where it isn’t faded, and where the sun is just so, I can see a strange, provoking, <b class="not">formless sort of figure,</b> that seems to sulk about behind that silly and conspicuous front design.

                    I really have discovered something at last.
                    <br>
                    Through watching so much at night, when it changes so, I have finally found out.
                    <br>
                    The front pattern <b class="not">does</b> move—and no wonder! The woman behind shakes it!
                    Sometimes I think there are a great many women behind, and sometimes only one, and she crawls around fast, and her crawling shakes it all over.
                    If those heads were covered or taken off it would not be half so bad.
                    <br>
                    I pulled and she shook, I shook and she pulled, and before morning we had peeled off yards of that paper.
                    A strip about as high as my head and half around the room.
                    And then when the sun came and that awful pattern began to laugh at me I declared I would finish it to-day!
                    <br>
                    <b class="not">“I’ve got out at last,”</b> said I.
