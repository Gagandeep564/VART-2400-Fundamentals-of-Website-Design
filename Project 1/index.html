             </h2>

             <p class="summary-paragraph">
                The <i>Hunger Games</i> is a dystopian novel trilogy written by Suzanne Collins. It is set in a future society called Panem, where the Capitol rules over 12 oppressed districts. Each district is responsible for producing a specific resource essential to Panem's survival. However, the districts are marked by stark economic inequality, with District 1 being the wealthiest and District 12 the most impoverished. Every year, the Capitol holds the Hunger Games, a televised event in which a boy and a girl, known as "tributes," from each district must fight to the death in an arena, with only one victor allowed to survive. The Games are a tool of fear and control used by the Capitol to remind the districts of their powerlessness.

                The story follows Katniss Everdeen, a 16-year-old girl from District 12, who volunteers to take her sister Prim’s place as a tribute. Alongside her is Peeta Mellark, the male tribute from her district. The two are thrust into the brutal Games.

            <p class="summary-paragraph">
                Katniss becomes a symbol of rebellion through her defiance of the Games' rules, especially when she and Peeta decide to threaten a dual suicide to avoid killing each other, forcing the Capitol to allow them both to win. This act of rebellion sparks the beginning of a larger resistance against the Capitol's oppressive rule.

               <p class="paragraph-of-review">
                Suzanne Collins' <i>The Hunger Games</i> is a dystopian novel that transcends the boundaries of young adult fiction, mirroring the complexities and inequalities of the modern world.

                At its heart <i>The Hunger Games</i> is a commentary on power and wealth disparity. The contrast between the opulent Capitol and the impoverished districts paints a stark picture of inequality. The Capitol is a dazzling metropolis, home to an elite few who indulge in excess, luxury, and frivolity. Meanwhile, the districts, especially the outer ones like District 12, are mired in poverty, forced to scrape by with meager resources, constantly under the threat of starvation and oppression. The Capitol’s wealth is not just an accident of circumstance; it is built on the exploitation and suffering of the districts, which must produce goods and services for the elite while receiving little in return. This parallels the real-world dynamics of wealth concentration, where the labor of the working class generates immense profits for the top 1%, often leaving the lower class in a cycle of poverty and hardship. The districts’ subjugation to the Capitol mirrors how many marginalized and economically disadvantaged communities find themselves trapped within unjust systems that benefit the wealthy at their expense.

                In Panem, the Hunger Games are presented as a grand spectacle—a form of entertainment broadcast live to the citizens of the Capitol and the districts alike. While some of the districts view the Games with dread, fully aware of the horrors of losing loved ones, the Capitol’s citizens and the more wealthy districts are entirely desensitized to the violence. For them, the Games are a source of thrill and excitement without any real regard for the suffering and death involved. They have become so removed from the humanity of the participants that they see the tributes not as people, but as mere contestants in a game. This mirrors modern society’s relationship with media, particularly when it comes to the depiction of violence. With 24-hour news cycles and social media platforms, people are constantly bombarded with images and stories of conflict, death, and suffering. Over time, this relentless exposure can lead to desensitization where tragedies are reduced to mere stories, consumed and forgotten as part of the entertainment cycle.
